         <p> A lot of fun solo or with friends or even with random people online, this games brings the series to the mainstream without all of the jank of the older titles. 
	   Don't be fooled though, while a lot of the Jank has been removed it is still a very hard game. But that difficulty brings the best out of you. The games give an insane sense of acomplishment when you finally overcome that wall.
	   This game style is hard to get into, but when it all finally clicks you can understand why people sink thousands of hours into the game. I have even done some personal speedrunning of my favorite monsters.

      <p id = "testp" class = "funParagraph">This old game has been given new life due to a huge QoL (quality of life) mod, <a href="https://openrct2.org/">OpenRct2</a>. The devs of the mod are very dedicated.
         They had to learn assembly to translate the game into C++. This coding language translation allows for tons of new things, including multiplayer and custom rides.
         Nowadays, it feels less like a park managment game and more of a form of art expression. It is a lot more interesting to create something that could only exist in RCT2 instead of trying to make the best park possible.

         <p>While this game does get quite a bad rep in the gaming community with its toxic community, the core of the game is exceptional. No other game is so dependent on individual skill and game knowlege.
            Its that interesting blend that keeps bringing me back. Despite the frustrating balance changes, toxicity, and long game times I keep coming back soley because of that core gameplay loop. However I would definetly not reccomend LoL to new players.
